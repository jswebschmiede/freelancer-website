# Content Management Guide

## Project Content Structure

- Projects are stored as MDX files in [src/content/projects/](mdc:src/content/projects/)
- Each project has its own MDX file (e.g., [bea.mdx](mdc:src/content/projects/bea.mdx))
- Project images are stored in [src/content/projects/images/](mdc:src/content/projects/images/)

## Content Schema

- Content configuration is defined in [src/content/config.ts](mdc:src/content/config.ts)
- Follow the existing MDX structure for new projects
- Include project metadata, description, and technology stack

## MDX Files

- Use frontmatter for project metadata
- Include project images with proper alt text
- Follow the existing project format for consistency

## Content Rendering

- Projects are displayed using [Project.astro](mdc:src/components/Project/Project.astro)
- Project details are shown in [ProjectDetails.astro](mdc:src/components/Project/ProjectDetails.astro)
- Technology information is displayed in [ProjektTech.astro](mdc:src/components/Project/ProjektTech.astro)
